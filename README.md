# secondBrian

Second Brian is a platform on which a "second brain" or personal knowledge management system can be built. The idea here is to store thoughts, ideas, and knowledge in a logical and methodical way, so that they are easy to access later.

## Development Steps

The initial phases of development will be as follows:

- Creation of "topics" (directories) and "thoughts" (files)
- Creation of links
- Tkinter GUI
- Graph-like view of network
